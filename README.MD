# PasTit(Paste-it!)

PRETITIER README COMING SOON - But basically if you know about SPRUNGE.US this is a replacement for that since it has gone MIA, this is the second time its unexplicably gone down in the past ~6 months, and I found myself needing it too often (cant paste into a machine for some reason, weird TTY situiation? EZ win), so I took matters into my own hands.

How to install:

```git clone https://github.com/harryeffinpotter/pastit```

```cd pastit```

```chmod +x setup.sh```

```./setup.sh```


Sprunge+ - Like sprunge, but +
Use pastit to paste files like so

`pastit .zshrc`

`pastit script.py`

`pastit /etc/nginx/nginx.conf`

  Or just capture STDOUT like this-
`ls -la | grep "Feet_pics"| pastit`

`ping lemonparty.org | pastit`

`ip a | pastit`

`echo $YOUR_MUMS_FAVORITE_MAN | sed 's/your dad/me/g' | pastit`






Enjoy! Open to suggestions/ideas! Thanks
